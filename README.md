## Flask Application Design for an Ecommerce Website Specific for Kids

### HTML Files

**kids.html**

- Serves as the landing page for the website.
- Displays separate sections for boys aged 13-15 and girls aged 9-12.
- Includes navigation links to product categories and a search bar.

**products.html**

- Displays a list of products within a specific category.
- Provides options to filter products by age range, price, and other attributes.
- Includes product details such as name, description, price, and an "Add to Cart" button.

**cart.html**

- Displays the items currently in the user's shopping cart.
- Allows users to edit the quantity of each item or remove items from the cart.
- Provides a button to proceed to checkout.

**checkout.html**

- Collects user information such as name, shipping address, and payment details.
- Provides a summary of the order and allows users to confirm their purchase.

### Routes

**@app.route('/')**

- Home page route that renders the `kids.html` template.

**@app.route('/products')**

- Products page route that renders the `products.html` template and displays all products.

**@app.route('/products/<category>')**

- Products category page route that renders the `products.html` template and displays products within a specific category.

**@app.route('/cart')**

- Cart page route that renders the `cart.html` template and displays the user's current shopping cart.

**@app.route('/checkout')**

- Checkout page route that renders the `checkout.html` template and collects user information for order processing.

### Additional Considerations

- Use Bootstrap as the front-end framework for styling and responsiveness.
- Implement a database to store product information and user orders.
- Integrate a payment gateway to process online transactions securely.
- Consider adding features such as user registration, order tracking, and product reviews.
